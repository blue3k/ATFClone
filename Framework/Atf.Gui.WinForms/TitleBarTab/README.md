EasyTabs
========

EasyTabs is a library that you can add to your .NET WinForms applications (WPF support coming eventually) in order to render a list of tabs in the title bar of the application, similar to Chrome, Firefox, Trillian, etc.  Instead of inheriting from System.Windows.Forms.Form, you inherit from TitleBarTabs.  The base class takes care of the grunt work of rendering the tabs, responding to clicks to activate/close/add/etc. while you simply add TitleBarTab objects to the Tabs collection.  TitleBarTab objects expect their content property to be set to a Form object that represents the contents for the tab.  You can design these forms in Visual Studio the same as you would any other application; the Title and Icon properties are used to display the tab itself.

The library comes with a renderer for Chrome-like tabs (ChromeTabRenderer), but you can implement your own by creating a class inheriting from BaseTabRenderer.  The TestApp directory contains the project for a tabbed web browser test application that you can use as a starting point for implementing your own functionality.

You can include this functionality in your project via NuGet:

PM> Install-Package EasyTabs
